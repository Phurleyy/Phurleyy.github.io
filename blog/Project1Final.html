I remembered back to when I had first gotten into cars, and how far I&rsquo;ve come now. I could barely change my own oil then; now I was changing a timing belt and water pump in the dead of winter? I called a friend of mine to come help, and realized something; </span><span class="c5">I had finally found something that I could communicate to another person with, not with any strings attached or a lack of confidence, but as another individual, person to person. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 367.50px; height: 275.31px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 367.50px; height: 275.31px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c3">Whew, working on this car sucked!</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">HUMBLE BEGINNINGS</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">By the time I hit high school, I was probably the most awkward student out of my class. I felt estranged from them because of my lack of athleticism, my overreliance on online communication, and overall bad social and mental health (through no fault of my own, though. Covid hit during my middle school years and sort of messed up an incredible formative part of my life). I didn&rsquo;t know how to read body language well if at all, how to break into conversation during those all-important group projects, and most importantly how to connect with my peers on a deeper than surface level. My grades started to suffer as the</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;days ticked on. This wasn&rsquo;t due to negligence, it was because I lacked friends to talk to, and even study with. Over time, I was slowly eroding. I knew something had to change, and fast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c5">When I turned 16, I woke up with a radiating smile, I was ready to finally get my license and car. I traveled to the DMV to get it, aced my driving test, and as quickly as I started my journey towards a license, it ended, and I had it. At this point my grades had recovered a little bit, and my social standing was a bit higher than it was when I was an underclassman, </span><span class="c5">but still wasn&rsquo;t anything to write home abou</span><span class="c5">t. This all changed when I started looking for cars, though. I had a very small budget of around 3 thousand dollars for one (made from working odd summer jobs and a small part time position at Burlington Coat Factory). This helped constrain me on what I </span><span class="c5 c8">really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;needed in a car; reliability, practicality, and some semblance of fun. I was browsing ads on Facebook Marketplace for a while until I found it, my perfect first car&ndash; a 2000 Honda Civic Sedan. I went to pick it up with my mom in the dead of winter, the coldest day of the year&hellip; But my heart couldn&rsquo;t have been less warm. It felt so freeing to finally be able to drive anywhere I wanted, do anything I wanted to do, and most importantly, on the cheap with my car&rsquo;s little 1.6 liter gas sipper engine. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 320.00px; height: 339.89px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 320.00px; height: 570.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -106.11px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c5"><br></span><span class="c3">This is still the cleanest example of this model civic I have ever seen in person.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c0">Soon the car started to show signs of wear and tear, an exhaust leak, then a misfire in the engine. I was a broke high school student with little money to my name, though, and couldn&rsquo;t afford to take it to a shop where they would charge exorbitant labor fees. I knew what I had to do, I was just scared to do it. My dad ended up helping me work up the courage to get under my car and patch the exhaust leak I had with an exhaust band clamp kit&ndash; It was so satisfying knowing that I had the power to control at least this one thing in my life, how well my car ran. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 344.50px; height: 258.21px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 344.50px; height: 258.21px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c3">This is a picture of me changing out my civic&rsquo;s ignition system&ndash; I didn&rsquo;t particularly know what I was doing, but it worked out in the end.</span></p><p class="c2 c11 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totaled the civic in a freak accident where my breaks went out (NOT a product of me working on the car) so I had to find a new car, and fast. Luckily, my aunt and uncle had a car for sale, one that I had never seen before or since: an IS300 sportcross. I did my research and learned that it was one of three thousand ever made across the world (rarer than most Ferrari and Lamborghini models). I snatched it up with all the savings I had remaining and began driving it. It deepened my appreciation for cars because it turned my automotive passion into a statement, something people could recognize and point me out from a crowd due to. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 312.50px; height: 309.76px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 312.50px; height: 555.56px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -99.60px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c5"><br></span><span class="c3">The police officers that came said if I was 6 feet closer to the railing I would&rsquo;ve most likely died; talk about a close call. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">DEEPER INTO CAR CULTURE</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0">I soon began to do the oil changes of close friends and family, and people would come to me first and foremost with their automotive questions. It made me happy seeing that people could come and rely on me for such an important thing, keeping their mode of transportation reliable and roadworthy. Through these interactions, I further learned how to work on cars and it made me seem more trustworthy to other people. It felt like working harder for other people will make them want to work hard for me. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 382.00px; height: 267.91px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 382.00px; height: 508.89px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -158.09px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">My IS300, in all of it&rsquo;s scraping-the-ground-everywhere-I-go glory.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c5">As I grew deeper into car culture, </span><span class="c5">its</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;positive effects started to grow deeper roots into me.

People in the car community didn&rsquo;t judge me for anything people at school judged me for; no hatred based on my perceived smartness (or lack thereof), how athletic I was, or how &ldquo;popular&rdquo; I was overall. All they cared about was how clean my car was and if I was taking good care of it or not. The language of love that they used was more of a fit for me than anything I have seen, before or after. I finally felt fluent in something, no matter how untraditional it may seem to an outsider.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">PINNACLE OF ASPIRATIONS</span></p><p class="c7 c6"><span class="c5">Senior year, I had finally decided to commit entirely to my passion </span><span class="c5">for cars</span><span class="c0">&ndash; I bought a car that no normal person would purchase as a daily driver&ndash; a 25 year old, two door, gas guzzling V8 engined Camaro SS. Although this car wasn&rsquo;t a logical choice, it helped me express who I am as a person in a language that I wanted to express myself in, which, in my opinion, matters more than anything else. I had lived so long without expressing myself in a language before I encountered car culture, with that outlet available to me, it&rsquo;s like an entirely new world has opened up to me. I don&rsquo;t know what I would do without this automotive passion of mine. It allowed me to express myself in ways I didn&rsquo;t think possible, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be here at Notre Dame without it. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 382.00px; height: 278.76px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 382.00px; height: 278.76px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Once again, the cleanest example I&rsquo;ve seen of a particular car is the one that is mine.
